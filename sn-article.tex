\abstract{This paper focuses on the reimplementation of the decision procedure for WS1S logic, a second-order logic that can be decided using finite automata. The well known tool for WS1S logic decision, Mona, employs automata with transitions represented through binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Due to the integration of BDDs in automata operations, tasks like reversal cannot be executed in the conventional manner of reverting individual edges. Instead, the reversal of each BDD must be computed, potentially resulting in an exponential blowup. Motivated by these limitations, Pavel Bednar reimplemented Mona using a pure automata approach with the Mata library. This work optimizes the automata methodology, resulting in a significant speedup, up to ten times faster, in WS1S decision compared to Bednar's original reimplementation.}

\section{Introduction}
    The most well known decision procedures are SAT and SMT \cite{SAT_SMT}, that are widely used in various applications such as verification (e.g., predicate abstraction), test generation, hardware synthesis, minimization, artificial intelligence, etc. The SAT (satisfiability) problem is a decision problem which asks whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable. The SMT (satisfiability modulo theories) problem extends the SAT problem to satisfiability of first-order formulae with equality and atoms from various first-order theories. There are various high-order decision procedures such as WS1S, WS2S, WSkS, S1S, etc.

    This work focuses on the WS1S, weak monadic second-order theory of first successor. The word weak stands for finite sets, monadic indicates unary relations, second-order allows usage of quantifier over the relations, and first successors means that there is only one successor (e.g. the structure is linear). WS1S \cite{WS1S} has an extremely simple syntax and semantics: it is variation of predicate logic with first-order variable that denote natural numbers and second-order variables that denote finite sets of natural numbers, it has a single function symbol, which denotes the successor function and has usual comparison operators such as $\leq$, $=$, $\in$ and $\supseteq$. Richard Büchi presented approach how to decide WS1S using finite automata in \cite{Buchi} The main idea is to recursively transforms each subformula of the main WS1S formula into deterministic finite automata (DFA) representing feasible interpretations and simulate boolean operations via the operation over automata.

    The most used tool for deciding WS1S and WS2S is Mona\footnote{accessible at \url{https://www.brics.dk/mona/index.html}} which uses Büchi's recursion approach for the construction of finite automaton with binary decision diagram (BDD) for the representation of all automaton's transitions. The usage of BDD makes operations over automata faster but in the cost of making come operations such as reversion expensive (potential exponential blowup). Despite this limitation Mona is used in various field of program verification such as:  verification of programs with complex dynamic data structures \cite{DDS1, DDS2}, string analysis \cite{string_analysis}, parametrized systems \cite{parametrized_systems} distributed systems \cite{distributed_systems}, automatic synthesis \cite{automatic_synthesis} hardware verification \cite{hardware_verification} and many others.

    The previously mentioned problem with hard to compute automata operations when using BDDs motivated Bc. Pavel Bednář's master's thesis. The new pure automata based approach v
